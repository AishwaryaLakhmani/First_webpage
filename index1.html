          <p>Space exploration is the future. It satisfies the human urge to explore and to travel, and in the years and decades to come it could even provide our species with new places to call home-especially relevant now, as Earth becomes increasingly crowded.Extending our reach into space is also necessary for the advancement of science. While the observation of objects in space, known as astronomy, predates reliable recorded history, it was the development of large and relatively efficient rockets during the mid-twentieth century that allowed physical space exploration to become a reality. The world's first large-scale experimental rocket program was Opel-RAK under the leadership of Fritz von Opel and Max Valier during the late 1920s leading to the first crewed rocket cars and rocket planes,which paved the way for the Nazi era V2 program and US and Soviet activities from 1950 onwards.</p>
